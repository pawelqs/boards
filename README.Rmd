The goal of boards is to manage local [pins](https://pins.rstudio.com/) boards from many projects. [pins](https://pins.rstudio.com/) allows to easily read, save and version data using *board* objects. When working on many parallel projects, it can be useful to have an easy access to a selection of objects from many boards. The *boards* package uses a *central board* - all the project boards are a subdirectories of the main, central directory, and the data *pinned* to these boards can be easily searched and read.

 [pins](https://pins.rstudio.com/) allows to specify many different types of boards, including the Posit Cloud and AWS S2. **boards** package uses a local folder boards.

## Installation

You can install the development version of boards from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("pawelqs/boards")
```

## Usage

```{r}
library(boards)
```

```{r include=FALSE}
# Save the current boards dir to recover it after the readme is built
recover_boards_dir <- FALSE
if (file.exists(boards:::settings_file)) {
  old_dir <- get_local_boards_directory()
  recover_boards_dir <- TRUE
}
```

### Set the local boards directory

First, specify the directory in which all the boards should be placed.

```{r}
boards_dir <- tempdir()
use_local_boards_directory(boards_dir)
```

### Add project data

Now it is time to create project boards and save the data. In this example we simulate 2 projects. We want to save two data.frames from Project A:

```{r}
data1 <- data.frame(a = 1)
data2 <- data.frame(b = 1)

create_local_project("Project A")
write_pin("Project A", data1)
write_pin("Project A", data2)
```

and 2 lists from project B.

```{r}
l1 <- list(a = 1)
l2 <- list(a = 1)

create_local_project("Project B")
write_pin("Project B", l1)
write_pin("Project B", l2)
```

Project name is the first argument of the `write_pin()` function. All other arguments (e.g. `versioned = TRUE`) are passed to `pins::pin_write()` function.

### Search projects and pins

Now we can print all the projects created in **boards**:

```{r}
show_local_projects()
```

or to just get them as a vector:

```{r}
get_local_projects()
```

Knowing the neme of the project, we can list all the pins in this project:

```{r}
show_pins("Project A")
```

If no project name is specified, `show_pins()` and `get_pins()` will return the pins from all the projects:

```{r}
show_pins()
```

### Read pins

Pins can be read using `read_pin()` function, which takes a project name and a pin name. All other arguments (e.g. the requested version of the pin) are passed to `pins::pin_read()` function.

```{r}
read_pin("Project A", "data1")
```

For cenvenience, if no project name is provided, `read_pin()` shows the list of existing projects, and when no pin name is provided, it shows the list of pins in the project.

```{r}
read_pin()
```

```{r}
read_pin("Project A")
```


```{r include=FALSE}
# Recover the boards dir on the computer after the readme is built
if (recover_boards_dir) {
  use_local_boards_directory(old_dir)
}
```
